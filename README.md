# Book Recommender System

This repository contains a Book Recommender System that utilizes clustering algorithms and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend books based on users' preferences and similarities in book selection.

## Description

The Book Recommender System aims to provide personalized book recommendations to users by analyzing their preferences and matching them with other users who have similar tastes in books. The system employs a combination of clustering algorithms and collaborative filtering to generate accurate and relevant recommendations.

## Features

- Clustering Algorithm: The system utilizes a clustering algorithm to group users based on their book preferences. This helps in identifying users with similar tastes and interests.

- Collaborative Filtering: By applying collaborative filtering techniques, the recommender system identifies books liked by users with similar preferences and recommends those books to other users who share the same taste.

- Personalized Recommendations: The system provides personalized recommendations to each user based on their individual preferences and the preferences of similar users.
